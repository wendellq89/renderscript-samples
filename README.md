# Android Renderscript Samples

This repository is forked from the original [Android Renderscript Samples](https://github.com/android/renderscript-samples) repository:
- [RenderScriptMigrationSample](./RenderScriptMigrationSample): A sample that demonstrates how to migrate RenderScript to Vulkan.


## Update
- Only keep the RenderScriptMigrationSample sample
- Upgrades kotlin, AGP, build.gradle
- build new libVkLayer_khronos_validation.so file to support 16KB page size.
